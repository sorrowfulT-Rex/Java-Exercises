Also other random stuff...  

* Skew Collatz
    *The famous Collatz Sequence is generated from iteratively applying a function `f` on a positive integer. If the integer is even, then `f(n) = n / 2`, otherwise `f(n) = 3n + 1`. It is conjectured that all Sequences can reach 1.  

 * If we change `3n + 1` to `3n - 1`, however, it is easy to verify that not all of these "skewed" sequences reach 1. For example, the sequence starting from `5` is `5, 14, 7, 20, 10, 5, ...`.
   
 * By checking a bunch of numbers, we can make the conjecture that the minimum of a skew-Collatz Sequence is `1`, `5` or `17`. One can further conjecture that the distribution between the three categories is even.  

Also some coursework codes. They are in the package `coursework`.
